I am creating an ecom website. I want it to feel really smooth and high-end, with a very minimalist Bau Haus aesthetic. We will only be selling posters. I just want a really impressive smooth landing screen, we scroll down to see the products, and then an about Bio and the base. Brand colors are primary backlgorund of EFEEE7 with main text and elements 1E1E1E, and complimentary accent colors used sparingly of BA3B1A, EBB640, and 4A7869. I want it to be straighforward and easy to host on github, primarily a index.html, styles.css, script.js, etc like assets and such. We will use a Stripe integration to handle payments, and prodigi as the API for printing the posters and shipping. Make it a robust and fully functional ecommerce website, focusing on minimalism and an extrmely streamlined approach. You can use stock photos of posters for now as mock images in an Assets file, we'll upload my own photos later to the assets file
